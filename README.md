# start-reactjs
Start ReactJs is a standalone cross-platform desktop GUI software, which automates the process of initializing preconfigured ReactJs project without any hustle. It is lightweight and fully customizable, unlike default initialization 'create-react-app' command.

### Need of this application
This application is developed to overcome limitaions and disadvantages of well-known app initialization command `npx create-react-app`.
#### Disadvantages of using CRA command
- Difficult to add custom build configs. One way to add custom configs is to eject the app, but then it overrides the Only one build dependency advantage.
- Abstracts everything. It's important to understand the things that need to run a React app. But due to it's Only one build dependency advantage, a beginner might think that react-scripts is the only dependency needed to run react apps and might not know that transpiler(babel), bundler(webpack) are the key dependencies which are used under the hood by react-scripts.
- It uses Webpack web-bundler under the hood, but there are more efficeint web bundlers available like parcel. Which is super quick and lightweight.
- App initialization(creation) process takes more than the usual time.
